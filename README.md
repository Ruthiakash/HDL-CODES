# HDL-CODES
EXPLORING BASIC CODES FOR DESIGNS IN XILINX SOFTWARE..
Verilog coding is a Hardware Description Language(HDL) used in digital systems and circuits in the form of code.It helps for the design verification of circuits model and able to analysee the design constraints.
Includes both ASICs and FPGAs and supports a range of levels of  abstraction from structural to behavioral level .Used for both simulation -based deswign and synthesis based design
